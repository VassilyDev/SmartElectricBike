Embedded gadget that will change the way you look to a bike.


The bicycle is chosen by many people for travel. Many aspects can affect users of this vehicle, including climate, pollution and thieves.
I believe that all these problems can be solved by a single integrated device that works as a mobile weather station, an air quality analyzer, an anti-theft system and possibly all the things that can come in handy.
